# GIS Programming

The purpose of this repository is to save the exercises developed during the Introduction to GIS Programming course. \
The course then focuses on the application of Python in the geospatial domain. \
At the moment I'm interested in taking my first steps in Python and <br> 
the GIS universe seemed like a good way to develop my skills in this language.
